Iowa School Districts as maintained by the Iowa Department of Education, effective 7/1/2016.  Efforts are ongoing to improve the accuracy of Iowa school district boundaries.  Boundaries are verified with local officials and edited to conform with the legal description wherever possible.  Boundaries are updated annually to account for reorganizations.
